
## Fraud Detection Streamlit App
A machine learning web application built with Streamlit to detect fraudulent financial transactions. The app uses a Logistic Regression model trained on transaction features such as amount, sender balance, and receiver balance to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).
### Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanalisiddiqui/fraud-detection-dataset/data

### Types of Transactions taken place
- CASH-IN: is the process of increasing the balance of
account by paying in cash to a merchant.

- CASH-OUT: is the opposite process of CASH-IN, it
means to withdraw cash from a merchant which decreases
the balance of the account.

- DEBIT: is similar process than CASH-OUT and involves sending the money from the mobile money service
to a bank account.

- PAYMENT: is the process of paying for goods or services to merchants which decreases the balance of the account and increases the balance of the receiver.

- TRANSFER: is the process of sending money to another user of the service through the mobile money platform



### ðŸ“Œ Features

- Interactive Streamlit UI for user input.

- Predicts if a transaction is likely to be fraudulent.

- Displays fraud probability and binary classification result.

- Reproducible ML pipeline with scikit-learn.
